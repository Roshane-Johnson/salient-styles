# 🎨 Salient Styles

## ✒️ Description

Salient is a website that displays beautiful gradients for inspiration and use in design projects. Our motivation for building this project was to provide a simple and visually appealing resource for designers and creatives.

The problem that Salient solves is providing a curated collection of gradients in a user-friendly interface. With Salient, users can easily browse and select gradients for use in their designs.
